<p>I had a problem recently, when I wanted to deploy my azure website automatically from external git repository hosted on Visual Studio Online. Once I've picked the Visual Studio Team Services option - it showed me only projects from my worksplace VSTS, but I wanted to deploy from my personal VSTS.</p>

<p>There are currently two options to workaround this.
Use old Azure portal at manage.windowsazure.com or embed your login and password into repository URL</p>

<p>If you want to use the second option here's how you should do it.
Take a note that if your login is an email - you should use an escape characters "%40" instead of "@" symbol,
so instead of using yourlogin@outlook.com you have to use yourlogin%40outlook.com</p>
