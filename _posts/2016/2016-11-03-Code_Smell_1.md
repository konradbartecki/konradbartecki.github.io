Using ```async void``` is a massive code smell. It will make your exceptions lose stacktrace and you will surely spend countless hours debugging exceptions without stacktrace.
The best practice is to use ```async Task``` whenever possible
There is one situation where using ```async void``` is okay, and that is when asynchronous method is a top-level caller, for example. Tapped event handler.

```csharp
        private async void button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            //It is okay for event handler to be async void
            await ProcessClickAsync();
        }

        private async Task ProcessClickAsync()
        {
            //All other methods should return async Task
            //You can even use async with lambdas!
            items.ForEach(async x => await ProcessItemAsync(x));
        }
```

Q: Hey, but I used async without awaiting them because it would run all methods at once and make my program faster!

A: Please don't do that, take a look at [TPL Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd537609(v=vs.110).aspx)
